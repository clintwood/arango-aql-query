# ArangoDB AQL Query
`arango-aql-query`

Execute [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) AQL queries directly from within [Atom](https://atom.io) Editor.

Query files are must have a `.aql` file extension. You may like to use [**arango-aql-language**](https://atom.io/packages/arango-aql-language) package to add syntax highlighting to your AQL files.

Query results are output to a paired results file with `.json` extension.  See settings for more information.

### Query
By default use `cmd-q` to execute a query. If a file contains multiple queries, simply select the query to be executed and hit `cmd-q`.
